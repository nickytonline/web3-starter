This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

1. Start the project

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

## ## Getting Started (Gitpod)

The project can be run in Gitpod. Navigate to
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nickytonline/hello-edge-and-node. If you
wish to load it in Gitpod as an external contributor, you will need to fork the
project first, then open the fork in Gitpod, e.g.
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/some_user_that_forked_the_repository/hello-edge-and-node.

1. Gitpod will take a minute or two to load.
1. If this is the first time loading the project in Gitpod, it will take longer
   as all the npm packages are installing.
1. The project wil start automatically in developer mode and the app will load
   in the Gitpod preview window.

For move information on Gitpod, check out the
[Gitpod documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/).

## More

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This
endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.
